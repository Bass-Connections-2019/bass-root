This folder contains scripts that:

Go through a satellite image, isolate building rooftops using connected components, and automatically
crop a rectangle from each roof. This is then used to generate synthetic textures.

Input: satellite imagery, and ground truth (INRIA's buildings dataset)
Output: Rectangular patches/entire building rooftops for all buildings in the image

Works in conjunction with Models for Remote Sensing (https://github.com/bohaohuang/mrs)
